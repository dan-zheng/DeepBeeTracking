# DeepBeeTracking

## UNet

Train the UNet with `swift run TrainUNet`. This saves weights in "checkpoints/".

Do inference using this [Jupyter notebook] (which imports DeepBeeTracking). It
is configured to load some pretrained weights from the internet. You can edit
it to point at your own weights.
